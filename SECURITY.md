## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in SSHDeck, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, report vulnerabilities privately through the SSHDeck owner's existing
project channel. Once the standalone repository is published, this section will
link its Security Advisory form. Do not send SSHDeck vulnerabilities to the
historical upstream repository.

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Status Update:** Within 7 days
- **Resolution Target:** Within 30 days (depending on complexity)

### Disclosure Policy

- Please give me reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure
- I will credit reporters in the release notes (unless you prefer to stay anonymous)

## Security Model

### Authentication & Authorization

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Password Hashing | bcrypt with auto-generated salt |
| Session Management | Flask-Login with secure cookies |
| WebSocket Auth | Session-based with ownership verification |
| CSRF Protection | Flask-WTF tokens on all forms |
| Rate Limiting | 5 login attempts per minute per IP |

### Data Protection

| Data | Protection |
|------|------------|
| SSH Private Keys | Encrypted at rest using Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC) |
| Key Derivation | PBKDF2-SHA256 with 600,000 iterations |
| Per-User Isolation | Keys derived from `SECRET_KEY + user_id` |
| File Permissions | Keys stored with 0600, directories with 0700 |

### Network Security

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Security Headers | CSP, X-Frame-Options (DENY), X-Content-Type-Options, HSTS |
| CORS | Configurable, safe localhost-only default if unset |
| WebSocket | Authenticated, room-based isolation per user |
| Reverse Proxy | ProxyFix support via `TRUSTED_PROXIES` |

### SSH Security

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Host Key Verification | Trust-on-First-Use (TOFU) with persistent storage |
| Host Key Logging | New keys logged with fingerprint for audit |
| Connection Isolation | Session ownership verified on every operation |
| Credential Handling | Passwords are not intentionally persisted; Python cannot guarantee memory zeroing |

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Required

1. **Set a strong SECRET_KEY**
   ```bash
   export SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
   ```

2. **Use TLS** - Deploy behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS

3. **Set specific CORS origins** (defaults to localhost if unset)
   ```bash
   export CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com
   ```

### Recommended

4. **Enable TRUSTED_PROXIES** when behind a reverse proxy
   ```bash
   export TRUSTED_PROXIES=1
   ```

5. **Restrict network access** - Don't expose directly to the internet without protection

6. **Regular updates** - Keep the container image updated

### Container Security

The Docker image runs as non-root user (`appuser`) with:
- Restricted file permissions (0700 on data directories)
- No unnecessary capabilities
- Health check enabled

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Description | Mitigation |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| In-Memory Rate Limiting | Bypassed with multiple workers | Use single worker (default) |
| TOFU Host Keys | First connection auto-accepted | Review logs for new host keys |
| No MFA | Single-factor authentication only | Use strong passwords, restrict network access |
| No LDAP/SSO | Local accounts only | Use an appropriately restricted deployment |

## Security Audit

This project has not undergone a formal third-party security audit. The code has been reviewed with security best practices in mind, but use in high-security environments should include additional review.

## Changelog

Security-relevant changes will be documented in release notes with the `[SECURITY]` tag.
